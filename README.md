## Resources Used
- Api: [Pexel Api](https://www.pexels.com/api) , [Imgur Api](https://apidocs.imgur.com/)
- Icons: [icons8](https://icons8.com/), [iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/)

## Note
- Fake data for likes, views and comments is used as that was not available in response data from pexel's api.
- Using mainly pexel's api because at the time of making this project imgur's api was mostly down.
- Tags data is taken from imgur's api but if it fails ( because of api going down a lot ) then as a fallback hardcoded data is used.
